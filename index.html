<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Munif is a software engineer and data scientist with 6 years of
experience in building solutions for data analytics projects. His exper-
tise is in developing large-scale data engineering systems with cloud
orchestration, interactive visualizations in web dashboards, monitoring
and alerting systems for complex computer hardware, highly automated
data pipelines for processing hardware testing datasets, analytics
workflows for machine-generated logs, and investigation of noisy time-
series datasets from hardware telemetry. His educational training
includes a PhD in data science where he studied building complex data
products which combine effective ETL techniques with modern machine
learning and network science applications. He also has a background in
Electrical Engineering, where his areas of focus were digital sensors
and signal processing. He posesses state-of-the-art familiarity with
data analytics and engineering tools such as Python (Pandas, NumPy,
SciPy, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn), shell scripting, SQL,
Airflow, and Elasticsearch, as well as cloud deployment tools (AWS and
GCP).</p>

<li>Executed exploratory and investigative data analysis on noisy
telemetry and hardware testing datasets to identify anomalous datapoints
and variation patterns with <strong>Pandas, SQL, NumPy,</strong> and
<strong>SciPy</strong>. Communicated findings visually with
<strong>Jupyter</strong> and <strong>Plotly</strong> to stakeholders and
provided recommendations for adjustment of testing and operation
parameters.</li>
<li>Improved design of deployed data pipelines, improving processing and
reporting times by up to 97-99%. Monitored the execution of pipelines
with <strong>Airflow, AWS CloudWatch,</strong> and <strong>Slack
alerts</strong> as designated owner and performed effective debug
analysis.</li>
<li>Deployed statistical outlier detection methods with
<strong>Pandas</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong> for complex hardware
testing datasets and provided data consumers with interactive interfaces
for adjustability of detection thresholds.</li>
<li>Deployed the open-source <strong>Elasticsearch-Kibana-Logstash
(ELK)</strong> stack to provide tools and <strong>Kibana QL</strong>
workflows for collecting, organizing, analyzing, and reporting on
machine-generated logs from Linux systems and unstructured text data
from tests.</li>
<li>Developed scalable user-friendly dashboards, interactive
visualizations, and reporting utilities for hardware testing and
monitoring datasets using <strong>Plotly Dash</strong> web apps on
<strong>AWS</strong> servers.</li>
<li>Negotiated stakeholder relationships across the organization to
understand data producer and consumer requirements and inculcate a
data-driven culture across engineering teams. Led training and
communication efforts to improve engineering workflows. Mentored junior
professionals through close collaboration.</li>
