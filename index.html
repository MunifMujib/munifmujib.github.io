			<h1>Munif Ishad Mujib</h1>
				<p>I am an aspiring researcher with interests in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I recently graduated from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engieering.</p>
				<p>I am working remotely from Dhaka, Bangladesh as a Research Engineer at <a href="http://semion.ai">Semion Inc</a>, a Berkeley, California based startup providing machine learning solutions to a wide range of problems in different domains. With Semion, I have worked mostly on NLP projects such as document classification and sentiment analysis. The algorithms I worked with include logistic regression, support vector machines, supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) and semi-supervised CNN. Currently I am exploring named entity recognition using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) models and Neural Networks.</p>
