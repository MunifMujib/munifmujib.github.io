# Computing

## Workflow

As a data scientist, most of my projects require significant data preprocessing and developing data handling tools. The next phase of a project is exploratory data analysis or EDA, followed by model construction and experimental design. Finally, the project usually requires the development of an evaluation scheme and/or metrics.

Both in industry and academia, I have developed and continue to develop extensive documentation for code in order to make projects and tools accessible to others.

## Tools

I primarily use Python. For EDA, I use Jupyter Notebooks. I use LaTeX and Markdown for documentation. I prefer working in Unix-like environments such as macOS and GNU/Linux, but I have also been a Windows user.

I use `scikit-learn` for out-of-the-box machine learning tools and `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for results visualization. For more interactive visualizations, I use `d3.js` and `Vega`. -->
