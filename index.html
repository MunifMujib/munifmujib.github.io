<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>I am a data scientist currently working on my PhD at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. My background is in Electrical Engineering. I moved from engineering to data science through working on signal processing and pattern recognition problems. I worked for a San Francisco Bay Area-based machine learning startup for a year after getting my bachelor’s degree and subsequently committed to doctoral study in related areas.</p>
<p>When I was an engineering undergraduate, the only two courses I got an A+ in were Computer Programming and Sociology. So naturally, in graduate school, I became a Computational Social Scientist!</p>
<h2 id="research-overview">Research Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am primarily interested in data science problems relating to sociological and political research questions.</li>
<li>I work on application-oriented projects.</li>
<li>I develop systems and experiments in a range of domains from social networks to healthcare informatics.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>
<!-- + Exploring NLP applications towards clinical trial description simplification. March 2018--
: Collaboration between my research group at Drexel University and the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. An ongoing pilot project exploring the potential of NLP technologies in helping make descriptions of clinical trials more understandable to the average potential participant.

+ Expanding a Consumer Health Vocabulary (CHV) using a probabilistic context model. September 2017--
: Development of a machine learning algorithm that can generate entry suggestions for a CHV by analyzing user-generated text on online medical forums.

+ Developing a bot detection system on Facebook. September 2017--
: Preliminary exploration of bot activity and potential detection mechanisms on Facebook posts from news outlets utilizing a dataset of news stories annotated for factuality. -->
<ul>
<li>Developing tracking tools to monitor malicious follower-network behavior on Twitter.</li>
<li>Developed Python library providing useful abstractions for collection of geotagged Twitter data and algorithmic geospatial hierarchy construction as part of larger study of political activity in online social networks. Curated and shared a dataset of 2 billion tweets with the research community. Publication of this project is currently in review.</li>
<li>Collaborated with the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine on an exploratory project on information extraction from clinical trial records and patient-facing simplification of clinical trial descriptions. Presented as a poster at the TextXD conference at UC Berkeley in December 2019.</li>
<li>Developed a novel machine learning model for automatic expansion of the consumer health vocabulary, a relational dataset of medical terms and their colloquial uses, by analyzing user-generated text on online medical forums. Published at the IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics.</li>
<li>Developed tools and algorithms for bot detection on Facebook. Results and dataset development for this project were published at the International Conference on Web and Social Media in 2018 and 2019.</li>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>As a data scientist, most of my projects require significant data preprocessing and developing data handling tools. The next phase of a project is exploratory data analysis or EDA, followed by model construction and experimental design. Finally, the project usually requires the development of an evaluation scheme and/or metrics.</p>
<p>Both in industry and academia, I have developed and continue to develop extensive documentation for code in order to make projects and tools accessible to others.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>I primarily use Python. For EDA, I use Jupyter Notebooks. I use LaTeX and Markdown for documentation. I prefer working in Unix-like environments such as macOS and GNU/Linux, but I have also been a Windows user.</p>
<p>I use <code>scikit-learn</code> for out-of-the-box machine learning tools and <code>matplotlib</code> and <code>seaborn</code> for results visualization. For more interactive visualizations, I use <code>d3.js</code> and <code>Vega</code>.</p>
