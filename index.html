				<p>I am an aspiring researcher with interests in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I recently graduated from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engieering.</p>
				<p>I am currently working remotely from Dhaka, Bangladesh as a Research Engineer at <a href="http://semion.ai">Semion Inc</a>, a Berkeley, California based startup providing machine learning solutions to a wide range of problems in different domains. With Semion, I have worked mostly on NLP projects such as document classification and sentiment analysis. The algorithms I worked with include logistic regression, support vector machines, supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) and semi-supervised CNN. Currently I am exploring named entity recognition using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) models and Neural Networks.</p>
				<p>I was part of the champion team at the <a href="http://www.icassp2016.org/SPCup.asp">IEEE Signal Processing Cup 2016</a>. The SP Cup final round took place as part of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2016 in Shanghai, China. Our team from BUET, Resonace_1011, was comprised entirely of undergraduate students. Our team supervisor was Dr. Muhammad Ariful Haque, who was also my undergraduate thesis supervisor. This is the 3rd year in a row that teams under Professor Haque have been placed in the top 3 in the Signal Processing Cup. We faced intense competition from talented teams from Purdue University, Indian Institute of Technology, University of Waterloo, Canada, University of Science and Technology of China, University of New South Wales, Australia, and more. Becoming the champion of the SP Cup is one of my proudest achievements. The challenge of the 2016 SP Cup was entitled "Exploring Power Signatures for Location Forensics of Media Recordings". In this challenge, we developed a classifier that can detect the location of an audio recording from the embedded Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) in the audio file. This project was my first major exposure to machine learning techniques, and I learned a lot in the months that we worked on it.</p>
