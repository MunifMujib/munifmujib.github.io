# About

I am Munif Ishad Mujib, a data scientist currently working on my PhD at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. My background is in Electrical Engineering. I moved from engineering to data science through working on signal processing and pattern recognition problems. I worked for a San Francisco Bay Area-based machine learning startup for a year after getting my bachelor's degree and subsequently committed to doctoral study in related areas.

## Research Overview

+ I am primarily interested in data science problems relating to natural language.
+ I work on application-oriented projects.
+ I develop systems and experiments in a range of domains from social networks to healthcare informatics.

## Experience

+ Research Assistant at College of Computing and Informatics, Drexel University. September 2017--
: I am part of the Computational Open Data Exploration and Discovery (CODED) lab at Drexel CCI. My academic advisor is Dr. Jake Ryland Williams. We work on a wide range of data science and NLP problems.
+ Natural Language Processing Researcher at Semion Inc. July 2016--July 2017.
: As an NLP researcher at Semion, I developed state-of-the-art machine learning systems for application in legal, financial, and medical domains. The primary research focus was the application of scalable Deep Learning technologies to real-world problems.

## Education

+ Ph.D., Information Science. Drexel University. 2017--
+ B.Sc., Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. 2011--2016

# Projects

+ Exploring NLP applications towards clinical trial description simplification. March 2018--
: Collaboration between my research group at Drexel University and the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. An ongoing pilot project exploring the potential of NLP technologies in helping make descriptions of clinical trials more understandable to the average potential participant.

+ Expanding a Consumer Health Vocabulary (CHV) using a probabilistic context model. September 2017--
: Development of a machine learning algorithm that can generate entry suggestions for a CHV by analyzing user-generated text on online medical forums.

+ Developing a bot detection system on Facebook. September 2017--
: Preliminary exploration of bot activity and potential detection mechanisms on Facebook posts from news outlets utilizing a dataset of news stories annotated for factuality.

# Computing

## Workflow

As a data scientist, most of my projects require significant data preprocessing and developing data handling tools. The next phase of a project is exploratory data analysis or EDA followed by model construction and experimental design. Finally, the project usually requires the development of an evaluation scheme and/or metrics.

Both in industry and academia, I have developed and continue to develop extensive documentation for code in order to make projects and tools accessible to others.

## Tools

I primarily use Python. For development, I use Jupyter Notebooks. I use LaTeX and Markdown for documentation. I prefer working in Unix-like environments such as macOS and GNU/Linux, but I have also been a Windows user.

I use `scikit-learn` for out-of-the-box machine learning tools and `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for results visualization.
