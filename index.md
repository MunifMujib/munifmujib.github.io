# About

Munif is a software engineer and data scientist with 6 years of experience in building solutions for data analytics projects. His exper- tise is in developing large-scale data engineering systems with cloud orchestration, interactive visualizations in web dashboards, monitoring and alerting systems for complex computer hardware, highly automated data pipelines for processing hardware testing datasets, analytics workflows for machine-generated logs, and investigation of noisy time- series datasets from hardware telemetry. His educational training includes a PhD in data science where he studied building complex data products which combine effective ETL techniques with modern machine learning and network science applications. He also has a background in Electrical Engineering, where his areas of focus were digital sensors and signal processing. He posesses state-of-the-art familiarity with data analytics and engineering tools such as Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn), shell scripting, SQL, Airflow, and Elasticsearch, as well as cloud deployment tools (AWS and GCP).

# Experience

### __Cerebras Systems__
Sunnyvale, CA\
Senior Data Scientist (Data Analytics) __Apr 2022 -- Present__\

  - Architected and developed ETL data pipelines and automations centered on real-time telemetry and testing data collection, preprocessing, and analysis using __Python, Pandas, Airflow, PostgreSQL, TimeScaleDB, InfluxDB, Git,__ and __AWS__ infrastructure-as-code mechanisms. 
  - Developed design documents, implemented agile project management on __Jira__, and documented pipelines on internal Sphinx webserver with __rST__.
  - Executed exploratory and investigative data analysis on noisy telemetry and hardware testing datasets to identify anomalous datapoints and variation patterns with __Pandas, SQL, NumPy,__ and __SciPy__. Communicated findings visually with __Jupyter__ and __Plotly__ to stakeholders and provided recommendations for adjustment of testing and operation parameters. 
  - Improved design of deployed data pipelines, improving processing and reporting times by up to 97-99\%. Monitored the execution of pipelines with __Airflow, AWS CloudWatch,__ and __Slack alerts__ as designated owner and performed effective debug analysis.
  - Deployed statistical outlier detection methods with __Pandas__ and __SQL__ for complex hardware testing datasets and provided data consumers with interactive interfaces for adjustability of detection thresholds.
  - Deployed the open-source __Elasticsearch-Kibana-Logstash (ELK)__ stack to provide tools and __Kibana QL__ workflows for collecting, organizing, analyzing, and reporting on machine-generated logs from Linux systems and unstructured text data from tests.
  - Developed scalable user-friendly dashboards, interactive visualizations, and reporting utilities for hardware testing and monitoring datasets using __Plotly Dash__ web apps on __AWS__ servers.
  - Negotiated stakeholder relationships across the organization to understand data producer and consumer requirements and inculcate a data-driven culture across engineering teams. Led training and communication efforts to improve engineering workflows. Mentored junior professionals through close collaboration.  


### College of Computing and Informatics, Drexel University
Philadelphia, PA\
Data Scientist, Doctoral Researcher (CODED Lab  ) __Sep 2017 -- Mar 2022__\

  - Built a prototype news aggregator that combined graph partitioning algorithms, transformer neural language models (MiniLM/DistilBERT), and clustering techniques (HDBSCAN) to group, summarize, and connect news stories and social conversations with __PyTorch, PySpark,__ and __scikit-learn__. Built a terabyte-scale real-time ETL system on top of public APIs and constructed a graph dataset of 3M news articles and 1.5B social posts with __MongoDB__ and __NetworkX__. Published as PhD dissertation and multiple papers, presented at the HICSS conference.
  - Developed continuous activity tracking analytics tools to monitor malicious coordinated campaigns and botnets on 3M social accounts with __scikit-learn, SciPy,__ and __Plotly.__ Presented at IC2S2.
  - Developed supervised machine learning classifier with __scikit-learn__ and __NumPy__ for bot detection on social platforms using a veracity-annotated news discussion dataset consisting of 1.6M user-generated text records. Published and presented at ICWSM.
  - Designed a prototype conversational agent incorporating a neural NLP pipeline (GPT-2 based) for mental health support using __PyTorch__ and __DeepSpeech__ as well as a __Raspberry Pi__ client. Published in JMIR Human Factors and presented at EAI PervasiveHealth.
  - Developed a low-cost frequency-based NLP algorithm for automatic expansion of a relational dataset of medical terms using user-generated text corpora with __NumPy__ and __SpaCy__. Published at ICHI.

### Semion Inc.
Dhaka, Bangladesh / Berkeley, CA\
