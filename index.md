# Experience

+ **CODED Lab, College of Computing and Informatics, Drexel University**,
Philadelphia, PA\
Data Scientist, Doctoral Researcher **Sep 2017 -- Present**\

-   Modeling the networked production of news:

    -   Developed a real-time data acquisition and ETL pipeline for news articles and potentially newsworthy user-generated content. NewsTweet, the dataset constructed from this pipeline, collects over 2 million news articles and 700 million tweets.

    -   Developing a network construction and segmentation algorithm to identify distinct news stories and detect hierarchical topical relationships between stories.

    -   Developing a knowledge graph data model and API for temporally evolving news stories as well as their relationships to other stories and social content.

    -   Developing a real-time machine learning application that ingests data from Google News and Twitter, then utilizes the data model and API to expand story chains and recommends potentially pertinent social content.

-   Developed real-time, continuous activity tracking tools to monitor malicious follower behavior (such as coordinated campaigns and botnets) on high-profile Twitter accounts. These tools track the follow-unfollow behaviors of more than 3 million Twitter accounts every hour.

-   As part of CLARITY, an NSF-funded project, developed BotBegone, an application that helps Facebook page moderators monitor malicious and inauthentic activity on their pages. Developed the feature engineering and supervised machine learning system for bot detection for this project using a veracity-annotated news discussion dataset from Facebook consisting of more than 1.6 million user comments.

-   Developed an acquisition and ETL pipeline for geotagged Twitter data (resulting in a dataset with more than 3 billion tweets) for hierarchical geographic querying.

-   Designed a prototype conversational agent incorporating novel NLP pipelines for health management support in collaboration with the Michigan State University College of Nursing. Evaluated neural language model-based chatbot performance in the context of therapist-patient dialogue, collaborating with the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.

-   Prototyped an NLP application for patient-facing information extraction and simplification of clinical trial descriptions in collaboration with the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine.

-   Developed a low-cost NLP algorithm for automatic expansion of the consumer health vocabulary, a relational dataset of medical terms and their colloquial uses, by analyzing user-generated text from online medical forums.

# Computing

## Workflow

As a data scientist, most of my projects require significant data preprocessing and developing data handling tools. The next phase of a project is exploratory data analysis or EDA, followed by model construction and experimental design. Finally, the project usually requires the development of an evaluation scheme and/or metrics.

Both in industry and academia, I have developed and continue to develop extensive documentation for code in order to make projects and tools accessible to others.

## Tools

I primarily use Python. For EDA, I use Jupyter Notebooks. I use LaTeX and Markdown for documentation. I prefer working in Unix-like environments such as macOS and GNU/Linux, but I have also been a Windows user.

I use `scikit-learn` for out-of-the-box machine learning tools and `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for results visualization. For more interactive visualizations, I use `d3.js` and `Vega`. -->
